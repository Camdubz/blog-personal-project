## Overview

This GoGanja MERN stack app serves as a foundation for building web applications with a robust and scalable architecture. The stack includes:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
- **Express.js**: A web application framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime for server-side development.

The project structure is designed to facilitate modularization and separation of concerns, making it easy to maintain and extend the application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) (Make sure MongoDB is running locally or provide the connection string)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/GoGanja.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd GoGanja
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized to separate client and server code. Here is an overview:

```plaintext
GoGanja/
|-- client/
|   |-- (React.js client-side application)
|-- server/
|   |-- (Node.js server and Express.js application)
|-- config/
|   |-- (Configuration files for the application)
|-- models/
|   |-- (MongoDB models for defining the data schema)
|-- routes/
|   |-- (Express.js route handlers for handling API endpoints)
|-- controllers/
|   |-- (Business logic for handling requests)
|-- middlewares/
|   |-- (Custom middleware functions)
|-- utils/
|   |-- (Utility functions)
|-- public/
|   |-- (Public assets for the client-side application)
|-- views/
|   |-- (Server-side views - if applicable)
```

## Configuration

Adjust the configuration files in the `config` directory to match your environment. Key configurations include database connection strings, server ports, and other environment-specific settings.

## Running the App

1. Start the MongoDB server:

   ```bash
   mongod
   ```

2. Start the Node.js server:

   ```bash
   npm run server
   ```

3. Start the React.js client:

   ```bash
   npm run client
   ```

   or for development with hot-reloading:

   ```bash
   npm run client-dev
   ```

## Testing

To run tests, use:

```bash
npm test
```

Adjust the test configuration in the `package.json` file.

## Deployment

For deployment, follow best practices for securing environment variables, setting up production-ready configurations, and deploying the application to a hosting service.
